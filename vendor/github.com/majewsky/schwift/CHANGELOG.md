# v1.0.0 (2021-05-28)

Initial release. The library had been mostly feature-complete since 2018, but I
never got around to actually tagging a 1.0.0 since a few less-used features are
missing in the API (mostly object versioning). The 1.0.0 release was overdue,
though, given that this library was already used in many prod deployments.
